    <h2>Description</h2>
<P>
    Try this snickerdoodle recipe for soft and chewy cinnamon-sugar cookies that everyone will enjoy. With crispy edges, chewy centers, and a deliciously spiced sugar coating, these cookies are a crowd please for sure. These snickerdoodle cookies have become very popular with my friends at church — and my pastor loves them. You will too!

</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>This snickerdoodle cookie recipe starts with 1 ½ cups of white sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter and shortening:</strong>A blend of butter and shortening creates the ideal rich, fluffy, and soft texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Two large eggs add moisture and richness. Plus, they help bind the dough together.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong>Vanilla extract lends complexity and enhances the overall flavor</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour has gluten, which gives the dough structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream of tarter:</strong>Most snickerdoodle recipes call for cream of tartar, an ingredient that gives the cookies their signature tangy flavor and pillowy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon-sugar:</strong>The snickerdoodles are rolled in a sweet, cozy mixture of cinnamon and sugar before they're baked.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong>Beat the sugar, butter, shortening, eggs, and vanilla together. Mix the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, then stir until well-combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll the dough:</strong>Shape the dough into walnut-sized balls. Roll each ball in cinnamon-sugar until they're all evenly coated.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the cookies:</strong>Bake the cookies in a preheated oven until they're set, but not too hard. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
